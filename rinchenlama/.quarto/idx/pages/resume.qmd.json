Artificial Intelligence\n\nC++, Python, ReactJS, Javascript, Swfit, SQL, Git, AWS \n\n## Professional Experience\n\n#### Python Developer (Takeo Tech)\t\t\t\t\t \n- Consultant for Dish Network, a satellite TV broadcaster\n\n- Worked in a team of 7 Engineers in order to achieve team goals outlined in every quarter\n\n- Automated a Software Validation process using Python cutting down the time from 18+ hours to 3 minutes\n\n- As a result of the automation, deployment frequency increased from once every 3 months to once a month\n\n- Wrote validation for complex Software Architectures in a microservices framework and generated reports to analyze up to 11 different microservices.\n\n- Onboarded new team members and provide KT of the applications under development\n\n- Developed Automation projects using Python, Behave, XML, HTML5, Azure, and Selenium to test Dynamic Ad Insertion on multiple Video Streaming Platforms\n\n- Used Boto3 and various AWS services with Python to monitor, retrieve, process, and analyze logs\n\n- Re-factored, maintained, and extended large existing monolithic Python code base\n\n- Reviewed and Managed Source code, and Resolved Merge Conflicts for multiple projects\n\n- Perform End to End tests manually and automated the same process using Python with BDD\n\n\n#### Student Researcher (Google ExploreCSR)\n- Studied and applied various Machine Learning techniques for Image recognition\n\n- Used PyTorch’s Mask RCNN - an Image Recognition Neural Network model to analyze food images\n\n- Won Third place by Presenting Analyses on State of the Art ML models in the poster competition\n\n\n#### Tech Fellow (CodePath)\n- Developed multiple complete iOS Applications and Projects following CodePath’s course\n\n- Taught an iOS Development Course  to 120+ students per CodePath guidelines with a team of 4 Instructors\n\n\n## Volunteer Work\n\n#### Organizing Committee Member (PyData NYC)\t\n- Planned and Organized [PyData NYC
