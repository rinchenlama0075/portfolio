## About me
Passionately Curious about anything that catches my interest, I have gotten my hands dirty with a variety of subjects ranging from building web and mobile applications to trainig convolutional neural networks. Whether it be analyzing data to make decisions or building specific components within large codebases, I am the person who can get it done!
I am a jack of all trades who can pick up any technology and deliver results. With my love for technology, I am looking to be involved in projects that would lead to human prosperity.
