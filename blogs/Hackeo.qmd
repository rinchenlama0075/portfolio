# Title: Organizing [Hac/<eo](https://hack.takeo.ai/): A Thrilling 3-Day Hackathon Adventure!

## Recruiting the Team: Assembling the Dream Team
#### Gather 'Round, Folks! Let's Hack Together!
Oh, the joy of working with friends! When I decided to organize the epic [Hac/<eo](https://hack.takeo.ai/) Hackathon in August 2022, I knew I had to bring together a team that shared my passion. With a little help from my roommate, friends, and their friends, we formed an unstoppable squad: me as the Chair, Aachal as the Vice Chair, and the brilliant minds of Mohit, Shubham, Ameet, Palisha, Sneha, and Tenzin. We were ready to make magic happen!

## Finding Sponsorship: The Magic of Unexpected Heroes
#### A Setback from MLH? No Worries, We Have [Takeo](https://www.takeo.ai/)!
We hit a tiny roadblock when [MLH](https://www.mlh.io) denied our application for sponsorship. But just when things seemed grim, a hero emerged! My employer, the amazing company [Takeo](https://www.takeo.ai/), came to the rescue and offered to sponsor the entire event. Talk about a stroke of luck! With their support, we knew [Hac/<eo](https://hack.takeo.ai/) was destined for greatness.

## Logistics: The Virtual Voyage
#### Navigating the Challenges of Virtual Events
Ah, the joys and challenges of organizing a virtual event! We dove headfirst into the logistics, determined to make [Hac/<eo](https://hack.takeo.ai/) a seamless experience for participants. Takeo's talented development team created a fantastic website that became our virtual hub. We relied on DevPost for registrations and used Discord for smooth communication throughout the hackathon. We even had exciting speakers and tutorials planned for the first two days to empower and inspire our participants!
#### Prizes
Every great hackathon needs winners and prizes, right? We decided to host [Hac/<eo](https://hack.takeo.ai/) with three exciting categories: Web, App, and Data. With so many fantastic ideas and limited resources, selecting the ultimate prizes was quite the challenge. We knew that the prizes would be a significant factor in the event's success, so we boldly requested a budget increase from our sponsor. Lo and behold, our efforts paid off! Here's what we managed to secure:

#### First Prize: Oculus Meta Quest (2)

#### Second Prize: Marshall Major IV wireless Bluetooth Headphones

#### Category Winner Prizes: Velocifire Portable Keyboards

## Marketing: Unleashing the Hackathon Fever
#### From Small Steps to a Roaring Crowd
Spreading the word and finding participants proved to be quite the adventure. We tackled the challenge head-on, leveraging the power of Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit. But we didn't stop there! We went old-school and printed out flyers to plaster the town with [Hac/<eo](https://hack.takeo.ai/) excitement. Our determination paid off, and before we knew it, we had a staggering 198 participants! Can you believe it? Our initial goal was to reach 75-100, but we far surpassed our expectations. The hype for [Hac/<eo](https://hack.takeo.ai/) was off the charts!

## Day of: Let the Hackathon Extravaganza Begin!
#### Lights, Camera, Hack!
The moment we had all been waiting for arrived â€“ the day of [Hac/<eo](https://hack.takeo.ai/) was finally here! With me donning the hat of an enthusiastic emcee, we kicked off the event in style. We set the stage for a whirlwind of coding adventures, inspiring talks, and mind-blowing tutorials. The energy was electric, and the participants were raring to go. The air was thick with excitement as projects began taking shape. Oh, the possibilities were endless!
